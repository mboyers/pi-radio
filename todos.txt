TODO:
Look for kotlin codenarc
The findStationAtTunePoint method exists in two files, is there a way to encapsulate the list stuff for each persisted object?
Consider sockets to push changes
Make which pots are checked configurable - might need to disbale tuner?
make voice configurable?
move license key for voice to speech api to be outside of application

DONE:
Strip unwanted text from iHeartRadio station now playing
Get now playing section refreshable
Thread for each pot, as it stands now, only one thing can happen at a time
gitignore
