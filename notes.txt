svn import -m "Initial version" pi-radio svn://localhost/boyers/pi-radio/trunk

Here's the chip: https://www.adafruit.com/product/856
Here's the sample code I copied for this solution: http://www.lediouris.net/RaspberryPI/ADC/readme.html
Here's some sample code that I couldn't get to work: https://github.com/Pi4J/pi4j/blob/master/pi4j-example/src/main/java/MCP3008GpioExample.java
Here's the bootstrap theme: https://bootswatch.com/darkly

Had to run "sudo raspi-config", then go to "Advanced", then "Enable SPI" to use pi4j gpio extensions, otherwise
I was getting the following message:
  Unable to open SPI device: No such file or directory
However, note that this was for the above example that I never got working.  With the code that actually works, this wasn't necessary.

To build and deploy:
./gradlew clean assemble
scp build/libs/pi-radio.jar pi@192.168.1.125:

To run in production mode or test mode:
sudo java -jar pi-radio.jar --spring.profiles.active=prod
sudo java -jar pi-radio.jar --spring.profiles.active=test

Here's the nginx configuration I used to proxy-pass radionomy traffic.

#
# At some point in 2017, radionomy blocked mpd, but still allowed Winamp (since they own it now).
# Turns out they were just looking at the User-Agent header, so this proxy changes the header
# to use Winamp's and radionomy allows it.
#
server {
    listen 80;
    # The following is needed due to the parameters in the proxy_pass directive, it's Google's DNS resolver
    resolver 8.8.8.8;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://streaming.radionomy.com$request_uri;
        proxy_set_header "User-Agent" "WinampMPEG/5.66, Ultravox/2.1";
        proxy_connect_timeout 60;
        proxy_send_timeout 60;
        proxy_read_timeout 60;
    }
}


PI SETUP:
-Change Password-
passwd

-Set Time Zone-
sudo raspi-config

-Configured Wireless-
sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
network={
    ssid="psosbnet-g"
    psk="snip"
}

sudo ip addr show

-Enable SSH-
cd /boot
sudo vi ssh (save empty file)

-Install Packages-
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-jdk

For static wireless ip, I used the router instead, giving it the mac address of the pi, this was under "advanced" tab, choose "setup", then "lan setup"
Here's the ip I reserved and the mac address of the pi: 192.168.1.130	sump-monitor	B8:27:EB:C4:D0:66
